            <p><em>The Viera may begin as part of the Wood, but it is not the only end that we may choose.</em></p>
            <p class="indent">-Fran the Sky Pirate</p>
            <p>The Viera are a beautiful and mysterious folk, shrouded in mystery as many spend most of their lives in the Woodlands they call home. Their tall, slender bodies adorned with rabbit-like traits creates an air of grace amongst them. Long, high angled feet require high-heeled shoes and dextrous clawed fingers help to draw a striking image of the Viera.</p>
            <h4>Seperate Paths</h4>
            <p>The Viera are a race of both males and females, but outside of necessary meetings to keep their race continuing onwards and taking the male children who have reached adulthood, they lead separate lives. The males of the Viera live secretive, lonely lives in which they shun everyone, even their own kin to fully pursue their sacred role as a Wood-warder. The Wood-warders patrol the Golmore Jungle and ensure no outsiders reach their former homes. That isn't to say the women are defenseless though, as the female Viera are as capable as the men, but turn their attention to defend their young and homes.</p>
            <h4>People of the Wood</h4>
            <p>The word Viera itself means "people of the wood" and true to their name, in different forests of Dalmasca. Both the Rava and the Veena boast tall, lithe frames and graceful traits of rabbits. The Rava make their home in the Golmore Jungle and grew to have umber skin and dark hair, allowing them to more easily blend in with the forest. In stark contract the Veena have very light skin and fair hair help them blend in with the Skatay Range they call home.</p>
            <h4>The Green Word</h4>
            <p>The Viera's set of laws are considered to be the laws of the forest in which they live. The Viera take jobs under this set of laws and restrict themselves from having contact with the world outside of their forest. Among many other restrictions the Viera subject themselves to, some find their ways off putting. If a Viera chooses to leave the forest they are considered an outsider from that day forward. These strict laws often drive Viera with a fire in their heart away to seek adventure.</p>
