        <description>
    <p>A Roegadyn woman stands locked in combat with a hobgoblin. With each swing of his blade, she meets with ferocity and powerful blows. The battle rages on, the woman feeding off the ecstasy of battle, receiving succor with each blow she lands.</p>
    <p class="indent">A man dashes into the heat of battle, his battleax swinging wildly around him. He lets out an earth shaking battle cry as he crushes the ground and all those around him with explosive force.</p>
    <p class="indent">A lightly armored figure stands at his ally's sides. His powerful voice echoes out across the field, empowering his allies as he leads his comrades into battle, axe drawn and swinging like a tempest of steel and iron.</p>
    <p class="indent">Like a symbol crash in an orchestra, a warrior is an explosive force which stands out in any situation. Their booming voice, raw strength and powerful strikes are their tools for victory.</p>
    <h4>Indomitable Forces</h4>
    <p>The warrior finds their roots in ancient tribes akin to barbarians. These fearless fighters are peerless in their control of a force which they call the inner beast. Warriors often come from tribal backgrounds in which they learn to nurture and control this inner animal, which in turn grants them beast like strength and ferocity. Warrior bands once roamed unsettled lands as nomads, enjoying the boons which nature offers and defending the weak from those who would do them harm.</p>
    <h4>Unending Rage</h4>
    <p>Not unlike nature itself, a Warrior has the potential to become a relentless force of destruction. Like a raging forest fire, or an all consuming tidal wave, a warrior can unleash their inner beast to harness its rage. This state of being is known as berserking. While berserking, Warriors continually chase foes and defend allies, using their bloodlust to keep themselves in the battle as a threat.</p>
    <h4>CREATING A Warrior</h4>
    <p>When creating a Warrior, one must consider their origins as a warrior. Are you a descendant of the ancient tribes from which warriors are able to draw their lineage? Perhaps you were a fledgling adventurer who found a mentor in the form of a former warrior who passed on the secrets of the inner beast.</p>
    <p class="indent">You must also consider why you have set out on your life of adventuring? As a warrior, have you decided to seek out dangerous challenges to sharpen your skills or sate the appetite of the hungry beast inside you? Perhaps you have taken up arms in defense of your tribe, a village or a loved one? Warriors set out for any number of reasons.</p>

        <description>
            <p>Beginning at the 1st level, on your turn, you can enter a Berserk state of mind, letting your inner beast act freely. While under the effect of Berserk you gain the following benefits:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>you have advantage on Strength checks and saving throws</li>
                <li>when you make a melee weapon attack using Strength, you gain a bonus to the damage roll that increases as you gain levels as a Warrior, as shown in the Berserk Damage column of the Warrior table.</li>
                <li>When you take slashing, piercing or bludgeoning damage, you reduce the damage by half your Constitution modifier rounded up.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="indent">If you are able to cast spells, you are unable to do so while berserking due to an inability to concentrate.</p>
            <p class="indent">Some warrior class features require target creatures to make saving throws. This is contested by your Berserk DC, calculated below.</p>
            <center>
                <p class="indent"><strong>Beserk DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency modifier + your Strength modifier.</p>
            </center>
            <p>Your berserk state lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or if your turn ends and you have not attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since then. You can also end your berserk state on your turn as a bonus action. For a number of rounds equal to 5 minus your Constitution modifier after your berserk state ends, you may not use the extra attack ability and your base movement speed is halved due to fatigue.</p>
            <p class="indent">Once you have gone berserk the number of times shown in for your warrior level in the Berserks column of the Warrior table, you must finish a long rest before you can go Berserk again.</p>
