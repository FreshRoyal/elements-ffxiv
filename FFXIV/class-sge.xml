		<description>
			<p>An escaping mercenary taking cover behind a toppled wagon holds his crossbow steady waiting for his pursuer to come around the corner. To their surprise a crystalline device appears and lets loose a blast of aether, subduing them. A young sage smiles as she knows this was another successful mission.</p>
			<p class="indent">A young man in crisp white robes watches as his allies brawl on the front line. Whenever danger looms over his friends, with a snap of his fingers a barrier appears, protecting them from harm.</p>
			<p class="indent">Carefully, an experienced mage begins to weave their spell, but the aether of their work suddenly travels to a nearby shard of crystal, a lightning bolt loosing itself from an unexpected place.</p>
			<p class="indent">Sages are highly skilled mages who've found a way to fuse magic and technology to bring forth the future of spell casting. Through use of their Nouliths, they push the boundaries of what is possible.</p>
			<h4>Aetherology Experts</h4>
			<p>Hailing from scholarly lands such as Sharlayan and Thavnair, Sages are scholars who have spent much of their lives in the world of academia, researching aether in all its forms. Its through this methodical life style that they were able to create cutting edge magitek, the Nouliths, tools which could change the magical world.</p>
			<h4>Shards of Power</h4>
			<p>The Noulith is a handcrafted combination of crystal and machinery, fueled by the aether of the user's body. A Sage shares the magic that fills their body with these wing like blades of crystal to allow them to fly around, launch bolts of aether, cast spells and a variety of other effects.</p>
			<h4>CREATING A Sage</h4>
			<p>Most sages find their beginning in academia, be it an official education, mentorship or independent research. When creating a sage one might consider how they gained entry into the world of education? Was your character incredibly bright and earned a scholarship via their raw talents? Perhaps they come from a well off noble family and their path was laid out before them by their parents. No matter their reasons for entering the academic world, you'll need to decide what drives their ambition to further their education and push the limits of spell casting and aetherology. They may do this out of a sense of pride and self interest, or for goals as lofty as bettering the world for everyone that lives in it.</p>
			<p class="indent">Beyond how they entered the world of academics, you'll also need to decide why they would risk their lives and perhaps even expulsion from the world of education. Reasons ranging from the realization that not all lessons can come from books and testing, trialling their hard work, or going on an adventure to improve their own standing in life. Sages are likely to have pragmatic reasons for hitting the road, but each person will have their own true purpose for adventuring.</p>
			<h5 class="caption">QUICK BUILD</h5>
			<p>You can make a Sage quickly by following these suggestions. First make Intelligence your highest ability score, following with Constitution. Second take the sage background. Third, take the Mage Hand, Mending and Prestidigitation cantrips and the first level spells Healing Word, Mage Armor and Magic Missile.</p>

		<description>
			<p>As an aspiring mage, you can cast sage spells, See the spell list included at the end of this document for the sage spell list.</p>
			<h5>CANTRIPS</h5>
			<p>At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the sage spell list. You learn additional sage cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Sage table.</p>
			<h5>SPELLBOOK</h5>
			<p>At 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st-level Black Mage spells of your choice.</p>
			<h5>PREPARING AND CASTING SPELLS</h5>
			<p>The Sage table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expand a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>
			<p class="indent">You prepare the list of sage spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the sage spell list. When you do so, choose a number of sage spells equal to your Intelligence modifier + your Sage level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
			<p class="indent">For example, if you are a 3rd-level sage, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare teh 1st-level spell cure wounds you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>
			<p class="indent">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of sage spells requires time spent in study and review: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>
			<h5>SPELLCASTING ABILITY</h5>
			<p>Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your sage spells. The power of your spells comes from your thorough research and preparation into aetherology. You use your Intelligence whenever a sage spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a sage spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
			<center>
				<p><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>
				<p><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>
			</center>
			<h5>RITUAL CASTING</h5>
			<p>You can cast a sage spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.</p>
			<h5>SPELLCASTING FOCUS</h5>
			<p>You can use your Nouliths as a spell casting focus for your sage spells.</p>
		</description>
		<sheet display="false">
			<description>You can prepare {{sage:spellcasting:prepare}} spells from the your spellbook. You use an arcane focus to cast spells. and can also cast wizard spells as a ritual.</description>

		<description>
			<p>Beginning at 1st level, you have achieved mastery over operating your first Noulith. These devices which combine magic and technology feed off the aether of your body to act and can be used to create a variety of different effects. At 5th level, you learn to operate a second Noulith simultaneously. At 10th level, you gain the ability to control a third Noulith, a fourth at the 15th level and a fifth at 20th level. When additional Nouliths become available to you, you are able to build them at no cost.</p>
			<p class="indent">Nouliths have are tiny constructs with an AC of 15, Hit Points equal to 15 + 5 time your Sage level, and a flying speed of 30ft. Creatures may exist in the same space as your nouliths, and are not blocked by them. Your nouliths must remain within a 60ft. radius of you, losing their aetheric link with you if they travel any further away. If this occurs, they become inoperable and fall to the ground. As an action, you may reactivate them by touching them and re-establishing their aetheric link with your body.</p>
			<p class="indent">If a Noulith is reduced to 0 hit points, it becomes in operable and falls to the ground. It may be repaired during a long rest at the cost of 10 gold in materials. You are able to restore your Nouliths hit points at no cost during a long rest as long as it is still operable. If they are totally destroyed, you must spend 100 gold and one day of time to rebuild.</p>
			<p class="indent">As a bonus action you may maneuver your Nouliths, moving them a distance up to their flying speed.</p>

Their focus on spell casting has provided them with the ability to manipulate their spells, setting them heads and shoulders above their fellow sages in this field.</p>
