        <description>
    <p>A slender Elezen woman draped in fine robes sits in a dark room across from a man who feels he has lost his way. Smiling she releases her Planisphere and a flurry of arcana cards into the air. From the squall of cards she draws and divines the man’s fate, instilling in the lost soul a sense of peace and hope for the future.</p>
    <p class="indent">A Roegadyn man stands behind his allies on the battlefield. He raises his Star Globe to the sky and begins to channel energy into his trust tool. Using the power of the stars above, soothing energy radiates outwards, enveloping his allies, bringing them succor in the heat of battle.</p>
    <p class="indent">A well versed Auri Astrologian stands before a congregation of people. She has come to spread the word of her rare new art, offering understanding of the future through the power of the stars. It has become her sacred duty to bring the stars into view for the common people.</p>
    <p class="indent">Whether they stand behind their allies granting them the blessing of the stars and moons of the universe, or standing alongside them on the front line, Astrologians manipulate the fates of both friends and foe to find success.</p>
    <h4>Wielders of Fate</h4>
    <p>The first task of all Astrologians is to gain a mastery over using the deck of sixty. To them, fortunetelling is a tool which allows them to interpret the stars themselves. Their deck is based on the constellations that they study. The Astrologians are gifted a divining deck when they begin their study from their master. They act as a conduit for the magic energy gathered by their star globes, passing the empowering magic from the stars to their allies.</p>
    <h4>An Elegant Tool</h4>
    <p>The Star Globe is a tool used by Astrologians which allows them to locate and draw in power from the stars. The globes are formed by large rings of precious metal and lenses. The rings are marked using a large spread of precise markings and which allows the user to find and map the stars in order to draw power without a view of the sky.</p>
    <h4>CREATING AN astrologian</h4>
    <p>Astrologians hail from a faraway island where knowledge is viewed as the greatest virtue. Astrologians are usually scholars by trade, and specialized in the study of astromancy. Often they find themselves born into the scholar’s life or into highborn families. Sometimes low born apprentices find themselves working beneath a master of astromancy and learn how to tap into the magic of the stars. Astrologians are blessed with the ability to read the future. Through the use of the deck of sixty and the stars they are capable of tapping into the future, though the farther they look, the less clear things become. Some Astrologians travel the land to share this gift of foresight with everyone, while others seek out opportunities to spread their young order of magic around the realm. Others track down allies and adventure, as the stars had mandated that the Astrologian set out on a quest for a task which they cannot see the end of.</p>
    <h5 class="caption">QUICK BUILD</h5>
    <p>You can make an Astrologian quickly by following these suggestions. First make Wisdom your highest ability score, following with Constitution. Second take the sage background. Third, take the Dancing Lights, Sacred Flame, Guidance and Truestrike cantrips and the first level spells Cure Wounds and Divine Favor.</p>

        <description>
            <p>As a student of astrology, you can cast Astrologian spells. See chapter 10 of the PHB for the general rules of spellcasting and the end of this document for the Astrologian spell list.</p>
            <h4>Cantrips</h4>
            <p>At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the Astrologian spell list. You learn additional Astrologian cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Astrologian table.</p>
            <h4>Preparing and Casting Spells</h4>
            <p>The Astrologian table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your Astrologian spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>
            <p class="indent">You prepare the list of Astrologian spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the Astrologian spell list. When you do so, choose a number of Astrologian spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your Astrologian level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
            <p class="indent">For example, if you are a 3rd-level Astrologian, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of Astrologian spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>
            <h4>Spellcasting Ability</h4>
            <p>Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your Astrologian spells. The power of your spells comes from your understanding of astrological powers. You use your Wisdom whenever a Astrologian spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a Astrologian spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
            <center>
				<p><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>
				<p><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>
			</center>
            <h4>Ritual Casting</h4>
            <p>You can cast a Astrologian spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.</p>
            <h4>Spellcasting Focus</h4>
            <p>You can use a star globe, planisphere or other similar tools as an arcane focus (found in chapter 5 of the player's handbook) for your astrologian spells.</p>
        </description>
