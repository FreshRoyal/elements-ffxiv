		<description>
			<html>&lt;p&gt;An Elezen man stands before a fierce dragon, it roars out and begins to take off in order to gain the advantage. With a massive leap the man lands atop the dragon and forces it back to the ground, creating an opening for his allies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;A Hyur cloaked in scale mail whirl's their spear around a cluster of enemies keeping them at bay. When the time is right they unleash a plume of fiery breath from beneath their helm, singing their targets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;A Viera woman runs and leaps high into the sky, magical wings forming on her body. With grace, she travels the currents of the wind, happily flying about as she exercises her new found freedom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;These fearless warriors stand against dragons, demons, fiends and any other threats who would raise a hand against their homelands. Dragoons use their command of both the sky and ground to strike down their foes with deadly strikes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Dragonbane&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dragoon was a soldier born out of need in a distant land. Their homeland has been locked in a war against dragon kind for hundreds of years, leading to their soldiers to specialize in battling back against dragons. Their most notable ability is the Dragoon Jump, which is powered by a magical gem each Dragoon receives upon completing their basic training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Masters of the Sky&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dragoons have been blessed with the ability to soar high into the air like those they have taken up arms to destroy. These warriors are able to crash down from the sky using their weapons and body weight to drive any skyborn into the ground, or cause great damage to those already on land. Wings will not grant you safety from a Dragoon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;CREATING A Dragoon&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When creating a Dragoon, consider what brought them down the path of a specialized knight. They may have shown a certain aptitude which allowed them to become a dragoon with ease, or perhaps were born into the role due to the history of their homeland. A dragoon may have decided upon this path due to the stories of famed dragoons of legends, hoping to become as powerful and respected as the knights they had heard about while they were growing up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;Consider why a Dragoon would choose to head out on an adventure. Are they seeking a specific dragon, hoping to slay an enemy of their nation? Could your dragoon have unfinished business with a dragon from their past? Sometimes a dragoon may set out for the sake of journeying around the land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 class="caption"&gt;QUICK BUILD&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can make a Dragoon quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Strength your highest ability score, following with Dexterity. Second take the Soldier background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;CLASS FEATURES&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an dragoon, you gain the following class features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 class="caption"&gt;HIT POINTS&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ul class="unstyled"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hit Dice:&lt;/strong&gt; 1d10 per dragoon level&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hit Points at 1st Level:&lt;/strong&gt; 10 + your Constitution modifier&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hit Points at Higher Levels:&lt;/strong&gt; 1d10 (or 6) + your Constitution modifier per dragoon level after 1st&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h5 class="caption"&gt;PROFICIENCIES&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ul class="unstyled mb"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Armor:&lt;/strong&gt; Light and Medium armour, shields.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weapons:&lt;/strong&gt; Simple weapons and Martial weapons&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tools:&lt;/strong&gt; None.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul class="unstyled"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Saving Throws:&lt;/strong&gt; Strength, Dexterity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skills:&lt;/strong&gt; Choose two from Animal Handling, Athletics, Acrobatics, History, Nature, Perception, Religion, Survival.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h5 class="caption"&gt;EQUIPMENT&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(a) scale mail or (b) leather armor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(a) amartial weapon or (b) two spears&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(a) a short bow and 20 arrows or (b) two hand axes&lt;/li&gt;

			<html>&lt;p&gt;Also beginning at the 1st level, as an action you are able to perform a jump attack. Through the power of your Dragoon Trance you leap up to 30ft. into the air and land on a creature within 15ft. of your starting position. The creature makes a Dexterity saving throw against your Dive DC as calculated below, taking your weapon damage and bonus damage equal to 1d6 on a failure, and half as much on a success. This bonus damage is increased to 2d6 at the 5th level, 3d6 at the 11th level and 4d6 at the 18th level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may not use Jump on a creature who is higher than 30ft. nor does not have at least 5ft. of space above their head. After finishing your Jump, select an empty space adjacent to the target creature to land on. If the creature's size is Huge or larger, you may choose to attempt to land on the creature instead by making a Dexterity saving throw of a difficulty decided by the DM. You do not take fall damage as a result of using the Jump feature. Movement using the Jump feature does not provoke attacks of opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;</html>

After finishing your Jump, select an empty space adjacent to the target creature to land on. If the creature's size is Huge or larger, you may choose to attempt to land on the creature instead by making a Dexterity saving throw of a difficulty decided by the DM. You do not take fall damage as a result of the High Jump ability. Movement using the High Jump feature does not provoke attacks of opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;</html>
