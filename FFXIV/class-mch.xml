        <description>
    <p>A woman stands before a group of goblins. Negotiations have broken down and the goblins have drawn their blades. Before they can take a step towards her, she unleashes a lethal bullet from her pistol, laying their leader low, causing the others to retreat in fear of this unknown weaponry.</p>
    <p class="indent">Carefully, an exhausted machinist puts the finishing touches on their newest creation. They flip the switch and the small tower shaped machine takes flight. It receives its commands and a tiny pistol lets loose a bullet destroying the target. A smile spreads across the master tinkerer's face.</p>
    <p class="indent">A man wearing leather armour approaches a horde of invaders who'd overrun their home given the chance. They toss a mechanical sphere into the group and in an instant they're enshrouded in flame.</p>
    <p class="indent">Machinists have spent many hours in the workshop to progress the art of war. From the creation of firearms, to the production of mechanical constructs for the battle field, the machinist ensure the gears of war continue to turn ever efficiently.</p>
    <h4>Forefront of Innovation</h4>
    <p>A Machinist is an incredibly skilled artisan who has decided to push the boundaries of current technology and has managed to do so successfully. They are capable of building a wide variety of machines and firearms which they use to overwhelm enemies of their homes through sheer efficiency. Those who welcome a Machinist to live within their city will be granted the boons of a true genius.</p>
    <h4>In the name of Advancement</h4>
    <p>The first step of a Machinist's path is developing an aetherconverter. This device draws the latent magic energy within the Machinist out and uses it to power their devices. Due to their aetherconverter powering their devices, there are few in the world who are able to use them. For that reason, it falls upon the Machinist themselves to head out into the world to field test their creations. The Machinist must push their creations to their limit and continue to modify them. As adventurer's this is the drive of a machinist, to test their equipment and rework it on a long journey in the name of science and innovation.</p>
    <h4>CREATING A Machinist</h4>
    <p>When creating a machinist you must keep in mind why they may be heading out on their adventure. Is your machinist field testing their inventions, or seeking inspiration to create even more intricate machines? Perhaps they are on a journey to make the world a better place by bestowing their creations for the common man. A Machinist has the most advanced technology at their finger tips and are using that technology to make life more efficient.</p>
