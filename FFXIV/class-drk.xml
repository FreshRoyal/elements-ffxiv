		<description>
			<p>An Auri man dives into the front line of his foes. Recklessly, he swings his blade with great might, cleaving through foe after foe. The enemy scatters, claiming they battled a demon that day.</p>
			<p class="indent">A downtrodden woman stands behind an ebony clad Hyur. Despite seeming to be on his last legs his exhaustion leads him to pull greater strength to protect the weak against those who had been pursuing.</p>
			<p class="indent">A lalafellin woman stands before a strange demon, clad in dark heavy armour and cloth, she weaves shadow magics before to unleash dark magics to put an end to the demon and silently protect the nearby village from its wrath. It is a dark knight's freedom from the bounds of the law which make these dark avengers so effective. Unconcerned with what is lawful, a dark knight is concerned with what is ethical in their view. Those who spread tyranny and injustice best prepare for a visit from a dark knight who aims to set things right and break the chains of oppressors.</p>
			<h4>Protecting the Mark</h4>
			<p>A Dark Knight is a knight who has taken up arms to serve the downtrodden. They serve no lords or institutions, believing no one is exempt from justice, no matter what their position in society. They protect the commonfolk from not only banditry and wild beasts, but from corrupt men who seek to oppress them. In return, Dark Knights are often fed and housed by those they protect, or rely upon bounty hunting and raiding looters to support themselves.</p>
			<h4>Infernal Darkness</h4>
			<p>When an adventurer chooses the path of a Dark Knight they understand that they are renouncing their rights to be a regular member of society. They belong to no society, acting as paragons of justice who see no allegiance. To assist them in their quest, Dark Knights are able to sacrifice their own life force to power a well of darkness within themselves. They cause themselves great pain and exhaustion in order to allow dark power to course through their body which they harness in a variety of ways.</p>
			<h4>CREATING A dark knight</h4>
			<p>Dark Knights are natural adventurers, living outside the law to see their goals to fruition. They may live within a remote village protecting the inhabitants from bandits, while the land's knights turn a blind eye to their plight, or they may travel the world seeking out institutionalized injustice and smiting it with violence. Dark Knights act on behalf of the common folk, and do so not expecting praise nor admiration. They are aware that they will not be celebrated in the history books like Paladins would be. Instead they expect to be demonized by history and happily accept this fact. One seeking to become a Dark Knight must be introduced to it through some means, be it an ancient tome with their rituals recorded or a mentor to impart their knowledge.</p>
